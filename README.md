# Regression Models using R: Workshop
Repository for the 2021 Summer R Workshop at Northwestern University.

The workshop is divided into five parts. Day 1 focuses on building simple linear regression. On day 2, we will explore model diagnostics. Day 3 examines variable selection and model building. On Day 4, we will check logistic regressions. Finally, we will check Generalized Linear Models on Day 5. 

The data is contained in the data folder of this repository, but you do not need to download the entire repository to load the data in the code.
